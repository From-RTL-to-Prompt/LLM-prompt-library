Help me write a test program that should include the following information:

Additional Operations:
Validate other operations handled by the FALU, such as register transfers, sign injection, and classification (e.g., NaN, infinity, zero).
Test special cases like denormalized numbers and rounding modes to ensure correct behavior.
Validate rounding behavior for different rounding modes (e.g., round to nearest, round down, round up, round to zero).
