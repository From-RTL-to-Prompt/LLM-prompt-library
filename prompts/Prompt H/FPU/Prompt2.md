Help me write a test program that should include the following information:

Basic Arithmetic and Logic Operations (FALU):
Validate addition and subtraction of floating-point numbers for all precisions.
Test comparison operations (e.g., greater than, less than) for all precisions.
Verify conversion operations between different floating-point precisions (e.g., convert from single-precision to double-precision).
