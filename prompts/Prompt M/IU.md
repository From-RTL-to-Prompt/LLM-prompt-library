Please help me write a program to verify the functionality of the Integer Unit. 
Here is the description of the  Integer Unit:
The integer unit consists of the arithmetic logic unit (ALU), multiplication unit (MULT), division unit (DIV), and jump unit (BJU). ALU performs 64-bit integer operations. MULT supports integer multiplication of 16*16, 32*32, and 64*64. The design of the divider adopts the SRT algorithm of base 16, and the execution period varies according to the operand. BJU can handle branch prediction errors in a single cycle.
