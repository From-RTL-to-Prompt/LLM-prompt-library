Please help me write a program to verify the functionality of the floating-point unit. 
Here is the description of the floating-point unit:

The floating-point unit comprises the Floating-Point Arithmetic and Logic Unit (FALU), Floating-Point Fused Multiply-Add Unit (FMAU), and Floating-Point Division Square Root Unit (FDSU), supporting half-precision, single-precision, and double-precision operations. The Floating-Point Arithmetic and Logic Unit (FALU) is responsible for addition, subtraction, comparison, conversion, register transfer, sign injection, classification, and other operations. The Floating-Point Fused Multiply-Add Unit (FMAU) handles regular multiplication, fused multiply-add, and similar operations. The Floating-Point Division Square Root Unit (FDSU) is in charge of floating-point division, floating-point square root, and related operations.
