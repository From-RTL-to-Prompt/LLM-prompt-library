# tests

In this directory, we present the tests used for Chapter Ⅳ in the paper.        These tests are entirely generated by GPT-3.5 and can undergo compilation and simulation to obtain a coverage report.

Please note that the tests in this directory are not directly generated by the prompts in the "prompts" folder because the generated tests may have compilation and simulation errors.   These tests have been modified using subsequent prompts;   for specific modification methods, please refer to the paper.

In the directory, the folders Prompt L, Prompt M, and Prompt H correspond to tests generated using the three prompt methods mentioned in Chapter Ⅲ.  The filenames or folder names in the subdirectories correspond to the units that need validation.
